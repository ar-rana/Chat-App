# Chat App

This is a full stack Chat-Application made using React, MaterializeCSS, MongoDB, Express and Node. 

## About

This Website's frontend has been deployed on Vercel and the backend has been deployed on Render. The `main` branch is the local machine branch and the `master` branch is the deployment branch.
Since the Backend has been deployed on Render it needs to be manully started everytime time the server goes down, which is some time after the application has stayed offline.

## Website

To view the application you need to go to:
<br/>
<br/>
[https://mern-chat-app-psi-one.vercel.app/login](https://mern-chat-app-psi-one.vercel.app/login)

This will take you to the login page, if you don't have an account you can redirect to the signup page from there. 

Since its possible that the server may not be deployed, I am attaching some views of the website after the login page:

## What I Learned ðŸ™‚

During this project I learned and implemented bidirectional communication in websockets using Socket.io, materialize CSS and Routers in express, state management across components using `createcontext` in React. I also learnt User Authntication through browser cookies and jwt tokens.
